            Building your own store
            Starting an online store may seem like a challenging task, but it can be rewarding and incredibly profitable when done right. The only drawback is that you have to market your own business and get people onto your site. Building a brand can also take some time. 
            
            The major advantage is that the profit is yours. You don‚Äôt pay endless fees on each sale or have to abide by any rules but your own. If this sounds interesting to you, here‚Äôs what you can do to build your own website from scratch.
